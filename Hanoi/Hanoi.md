# Simple Hanoi Towers
I implemented simple hanoi towers with a cute old style display on a command screen. 
Hanoi towers can be created with different sizes and solve interface will solve and display all the steps.
bool clear = true will clear the previous steps in given int milliseconds.
Finally place is the destination of the solved puzzle.
